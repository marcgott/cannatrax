## The Daily Log

### Print Page
It's not very convenient for you to haul your computer out to the garden every time you want to check the progress of your plants. For your convenience, you can print a list of your active plants and track their progress, then enter the info into CannaTrax.

### Date
Let's face it, we're all a little lazy when it comes to data entry. CannaTrax lets you enter logging information at your convenience. You can set the date for all plants at once by clicking the button at the top of the log.
